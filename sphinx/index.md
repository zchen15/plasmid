# Plasmid - A python library for gene editing

`Plasmid` is a library for reading, annotating, and editing genbank records in Jupyter Notebooks or ipython shell. This project was inspired by [ApE](https://jorgensen.biology.utah.edu/wayned/ape/) and [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/). The goal of the project was to address the lack of cross platform support provided by `ApE` and make the functionalities of `Biopython` more user friendly. This project is meant to serve as an open source interface for manipulating genbank records, querying genes, and manipulating NGS data in a programmable and user friendly manner that is cross compatible across all operating systems.
